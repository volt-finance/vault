This is a repo containing Opyn's Perpetual Vault Template Smart Contracts. These are a set of templates designed to make it easier for developers to build option-powered perpetual products on top of Opyn v2. With these templates, anyone can create custom vaults with different strategies and open up for users to invest. This is starter code.  We reccomend modyfying the code and making necessary changes befre launching any strategy.
